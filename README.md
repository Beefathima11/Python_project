Employee Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project involves analyzing employee data from ABC Company, containing 458 rows and 9 columns. The goal is to preprocess the dataset, conduct various analyses, and visualize key insights about the employees across different teams and positions. The findings help in understanding the distribution of employees, salary expenditures, and possible correlations within the dataset.
